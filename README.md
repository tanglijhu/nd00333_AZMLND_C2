# Project Title: Operationalizing Machine Learning Pipeline and Deployed Endpoint

The project's goal is to operationalize a machine learning pipeline with a deployed REST endpoint. 

The dataset used contains the bank marketing information including age, job, marital status, education, housing, loan, poutcome, etc. It is a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit. After Azure Studio automated machine learning training, the best model was generated based on the criteria of "accuracy". The best model was deployed as the endpoint, which serves out predictions about whether a client's tendency to subscribe to a term deposit. 

## Architectural Diagram

Step 1: bank marketing dataset registration;
Step 2: automated machine training as a classification problem with a creteria of "accuracy";
Step 3: best model generation "VotingEnsemble";
Step 4: REST endpoint deployment;
Step 5: prediction testing with the provided "endpoint.py" file. 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.



## Screen Recording

Below is the link to a screen recording of the project in action:

The screencast demonstrates:
1) a working deployed ML model endpoint;
2) the deployed endpoint;
3) the best AutoML model;
4) successful API requests to the endpoint with a JSON payload. 

## Standout Suggestions
